# `useful_programs`

A library/collection of programs written in Java.

## Production

**This project is still under production!** This means that not all of the programs will be stable. If you find any bugs, report them, and I will try my hardest to fix them as fast as I can (though I'm not that good of a programmer! :P).

Due to my schedule, this project may get updated very frequently sometimes and get no updates at all sometimes. Please take this into mind. Thank you.

## Projects

### `CheckLeapYear` (Package: `useful.leapyear`)

Checks if a given year is a leap year or not.

(added in v0.1.0)

## FAQ

Why does the repository name contain an underscore when it's written in Java?

> Because the very original versions of the project (you won't find it on GitHub; I developed it locally) only consisted of Python projects. I later reprogrammed everything to be written in Java, but the repository name is still in Python style.
